## Deposit Subscription

## **Overview**

This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. Term deposits are a major source of income for a retail banking institution. The bank uses various marketing strategies like telephonic marketing, email, advertisements, and digital marketing to promote term deposits. The goal of this project is to use customer data to forecast the likelihood of subscription to a term deposit.

This project covers multiple data analysis steps, including data exploration, SQL querying, building a Data Warehouse (DWH), and creating dashboards for visualization.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: For data analysis, preprocessing, and automation.
- **SQL**: For querying databases to extract insights.
- **Excel**: For developing interactive dashboards to visualize the findings.
- **Oracle Database**: For implementing the Data Warehouse (DWH) to store and manage data.
- **Data Warehouse (DWH) Modeling**: For designing a scalable and efficient data model to support business analysis.

## **Project Steps**

### 1. **Understand the Data and Business Requirements**
   - Explored the dataset to understand its structure and identify key features related to customer behavior.
   - Identified the business requirements and mapped them to the available data.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

### 2. **Data Exploration and Analysis**
   - Used Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to explore the data and perform descriptive statistics.
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into customer profiles and behaviors influencing term deposit subscriptions.

### 3. **SQL Queries**
   - Wrote SQL queries to retrieve specific information from the database and gain insights about customer segments and their likelihood of subscribing to term deposits.
   - Performed aggregation and filtering operations to answer key business questions.

### 4. **Excel Dashboard**
   - Developed an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize key metrics like subscription rates, demographics, and marketing campaign effectiveness.
   - Used visualizations like charts and pivot tables to make insights easily accessible to stakeholders.

### 5. **Data Warehouse Development**
   - Defined the business processes that the Data Warehouse would support, including term deposit subscriptions and customer interactions.
   - Designed a star schema for the Data Warehouse, incorporating fact tables and dimension tables.
   - Implemented the Data Warehouse schema in Oracle Database.

### 6. **Data Automation**
   - Created a Python script to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data into the Data Warehouse.
   - Integrated data from different sources to populate the database with customer information.

### 7. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - Analyzed data from the Data Warehouse using SQL to generate actionable insights about customer behavior and subscription trends.
   - Provided recommendations on how the bank could optimize its marketing efforts, particularly in telephonic marketing and targeted campaigns.

## **Key Insights & Recommendations**

- **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**: Focus telephonic campaigns on customers who have shown interest in other financial products or who fit certain demographic profiles.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Group customers by their likelihood of subscribing to term deposits to personalize marketing strategies.
- **Optimizing Outreach**: Adjust email and digital marketing strategies based on customer preferences and historical response rates.

## **Conclusion**

This project effectively demonstrates how to analyze and predict customer behavior related to term deposit subscriptions. By leveraging Python, SQL, Excel, and Oracle, the project builds a robust Data Warehouse, generates insights, and provides recommendations to improve marketing strategies.
